#AntiSLAPP

AntiSLAPP is an open source legal defender that can assist an individual with 
putting together a defence against a defamation lawsuit in Canadian jurisdiction.

Antislapp runs as a guided conversation, asking the user questions. When the questions have 
been answered, the AI provides the user with two documents: 
  1. A statement of defence for you, the user.  This is to serve as a starting point for the user's defence.
  2. A supplemental document explaining the steps involved in a civil suit.
